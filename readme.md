## Notes

-Implementation passed the tests. 
-Class design worked well, actual velocity and target were used for new velocities.

To do:
-Add more test cases for testing the PID compute
-Test that all gains Kp, Ki, Kd become assigned
-Make it so each test is a different google test so in Travis it will tell how many tests passed and failed.

- cmake
- googletest

## Installation
